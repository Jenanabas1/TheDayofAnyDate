# TheDayofAnyDate
Find the day of any date!

This program creates a UI, that anyone can then input a date in this format YYYY/MM/DD, and it will display what day of the week it is, was, or will be.

All you need for this project is some knowledge of java, and an IDE (I used NetBeans).

The video below was a huge help on how I made the calculations for the backend.
